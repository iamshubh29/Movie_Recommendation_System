# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests similar movies based on their genres and descriptions. Using **machine learning**, specifically **cosine similarity**, the system recommends movies that have similar content to the one chosen by the user. The content for similarity is generated by combining the movie's **genre** and **overview**.

## Features

- Recommends top 5 movies based on their **similarity** to the movie selected by the user.
- Utilizes a **content-based filtering approach** by analyzing the movie's `genres` and `overview`.
- Uses **cosine similarity** to calculate how closely related two movies are.
- **Efficient text vectorization** with `CountVectorizer` to transform text into numerical format for machine learning algorithms.
  
## Dataset

The dataset used contains the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each movie.
- `title`: The title of the movie.
- `genre`: The genres associated with the movie.
- `overview`: A brief summary or description of the movie.


## How It Works

1. **Loading the Data**:
    - The movie dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
    - The `genre` and `overview` columns are combined to create a new feature, `tags`, which will represent each movie's overall content.

3. **Vectorization**:
    - The text data in the `tags` column is converted into numerical format using `CountVectorizer`. This step transforms the textual data into a bag-of-words model.

4. **Similarity Calculation**:
    - The similarity between movies is calculated using **cosine similarity**. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors (movies) and outputs a score between 0 and 1, where 1 means the movies are identical.
    - 
5. **Recommendation**:
    - The `recommend()` function accepts a movie title as input and returns the top 5 movies that are most similar based on the `tags` feature.
